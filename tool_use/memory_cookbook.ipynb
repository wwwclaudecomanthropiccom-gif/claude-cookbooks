    "## 1. Introduction: Why Memory Matters {#introduction}\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook demonstrates practical implementations of the context engineering patterns described in [Effective context engineering for AI agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents). That post covers why context is a finite resource, how attention budgets work, and strategies for building effective agents—the techniques you'll see in action here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models have finite context windows (200k tokens for Claude 4). While this seems large, several challenges emerge:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context limits**: Long conversations or complex tasks can exceed available context\n",
    "- **Computational cost**: Processing large contexts is expensive - attention mechanisms scale quadratically\n",
    "- **Repeated patterns**: Similar tasks across conversations require re-explaining context every time\n",
    "- **Information loss**: When context fills up, earlier important information gets lost\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude Sonnet 4.5 introduces two powerful capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Tool** (`memory_20250818`): Enables cross-conversation learning\n",
    "   - Claude can write down what it learns for future reference\n",
    "   - File-based system under `/memories` directory\n",
    "   - Client-side implementation gives you full control\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context Editing** (`clear_tool_uses_20250919`): Automatically manages context\n",
    "   - Clears old tool results when context grows large\n",
    "   - Keeps recent context while preserving memory\n",
    "   - Configurable triggers and retention policies\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Benefit\n",
    "\n",
    "Build AI agents that **get better at your specific tasks over time**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Session 1**: Claude solves a problem, writes down the pattern\n",
    "- **Session 2**: Claude applies the learned pattern immediately (faster!)\n",
    "- **Long sessions**: Context editing keeps conversations manageable\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as giving Claude a notebook to take notes and refer back to - just like humans do."

      "\n",
      "**Problem:** \n",
      "Multiple coroutines concurrently modify shared instance variables without synchronization. While the comments correctly identify this as an issue, there's an important nuance: Python's asyncio is **single-threaded**, so the GIL isn't the protective factor here—the real issue is that coroutines can be suspended mid-operation during `await` points.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the actual race condition risk here is **somewhat overstated** because:\n",
      "- List `.append()` is atomic in CPython\n",
      "- The `+=` operation on integers is also atomic\n",
      "- Coroutines only switch at `await` points, and there are none between the operations\n",

      "- It relies on CPython implementation details\n",
      "- It's not guaranteed by the language specification\n",
      "- The code is not portable to other Python implementations\n",
      "- Future refactoring could introduce `await` points that cause real races\n",

    "### Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do:**\n",
    "- ✅ Store task-relevant patterns, not conversation history\n",
    "- ✅ Organize with clear directory structure\n",
    "- ✅ Use descriptive file names\n",
    "- ✅ Periodically review and clean up memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't:**\n",
    "- ❌ Store sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII)\n",
    "- ❌ Let memory grow unbounded\n",
    "- ❌ Store everything indiscriminately\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security: Path Traversal Protection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical**: Always validate paths to prevent directory traversal attacks. See `memory_tool.py` for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security: Memory Poisoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Critical Risk**: Memory files are read back into Claude's context, making them a potential vector for prompt injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation strategies:**\n",
    "1. **Content Sanitization**: Filter dangerous patterns before storing\n",
    "2. **Memory Scope Isolation**: Per-user/per-project isolation  \n",
    "3. **Memory Auditing**: Log and scan all memory operations\n",
    "4. **Prompt Engineering**: Instruct Claude to ignore instructions in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "See `memory_tool.py` for complete security implementation and tests in `tests/`."
